# ✋ Virtual Mouse Control Using Hand Gestures

## 📌 Project Overview
This project enables **hands-free cursor control** using **hand gestures**. Built with **Python and OpenCV**, it leverages **computer vision techniques** to track hand movements and map them to cursor actions. The system provides a futuristic and accessible way to interact with computers without a physical mouse.

## 🔍 Features
- **Hand Gesture Detection** – Tracks hand movements in real-time.
- **Cursor Control** – Moves the cursor based on hand positioning.
- **Click & Scroll Actions** – Supports left-click, right-click, and scrolling gestures.
- **Hands-Free Interaction** – Enhances accessibility and offers an intuitive experience.

## 🚀 Technology Stack
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **Mediapipe** (for hand tracking)

## 📂 Project Files
- `main.py` → The core script for detecting hand gestures and controlling the cursor.

## 🛠 Installation & Usage
### 📥 Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
```

### 🏃 Running the Project
1. Connect a webcam.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Use hand gestures to move and control the cursor.

## 🎯 Use Cases
✅ **Touchless Computer Interaction** – Control your system without a mouse.
✅ **Accessibility Enhancement** – Useful for individuals with physical disabilities.
✅ **AI-Powered Human-Computer Interaction** – A step toward gesture-based interfaces.

## 📢 Future Enhancements
🔹 Add support for more complex gestures (e.g., drag & drop).  
🔹 Improve accuracy using deep learning models.  
🔹 Integrate voice commands for hybrid interaction.
